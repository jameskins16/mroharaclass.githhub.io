<h1>Mr O'Hara's English Class                                                             </h1>
<p>In Mr O'Hara's class we have learned a lot this year. We have had 3 english teacher's in the last 3 years. Their names were Mr Doyle,Ms Hickey
  and now Mr O'Hara. This year we had to read a play "Romeo and Juliet" and watched the film "Beasts of The Southern Wild". We finished the in late March
  and analysed the significant key moments to understand the film better. The film touched on many strong themes throughout:love, hate, sadness, family, leadership and respect. The story was heart wrenching, they had it very tough but they
  always had family. "Romeo and Julie" wasn't all about love and family. In the end family has to end the love for good. In first and second year we read
  four book: "Private Peaceful", "Wonder", "The Outsiders" and "Of Mice and Men". We did a lot of oral project work - in first year we did a project
  on a new drink we made. In second year we did our dream job and a interview/play or a news report. THIS YEAR THE focused firstly on completing our Collection of Texts, which in turn prepared us for the Assessment Task (10% of the Junior Cycle grade in English)
  and finally the play and the film mentioned above. You can click the link to watch Keiran and I, two students of his class interviewing him about
  being an English teacher and what its like teaching students at both Junior and Senior level.</p>
